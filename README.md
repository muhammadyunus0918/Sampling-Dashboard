Grade Control Dashboard is an interactive Streamlit application designed for geologists and exploration teams to analyze grade control sampling data efficiently and visually.

This dashboard enables users to:

Filter data by profile, material type, and depth range

Visualize data in interactive 2D & 3D plots (scatter, boxplot, heatmap)

Display sampling points on an interactive map

Perform ore classification predictions (if a trained ML model is available)

Export filtered results to CSV & Excel

Save classification history to a local SQLite database
